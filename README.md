**Technologies:** C++, Python, ROS, Linux, XML, STM32, UART, I2C, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Git, OpenCV, Solidworks, LiDAR, PID, IMU, Encoders, EKF

## Introduction

This project, undertaken in collaboration with AerobotiX for the International Eurobot 2023 competition which is hosted by Planètes Sciences every year in France, delves into the realm of multi-robot coordination within dynamic environments. By harnessing an array of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, our aim was to streamline the execution of multiple game tasks for 2 differential drive robots.

## Project Scope

Commencing from July 29, 2022, to May 5, 2023, our project journey was marked by intensive research, development, and testing phases. Led by a proficient team, our efforts were concentrated on the strategic design, optimization, and testing of multiple robotic system prototypes, each tailored to excel in dynamic environments.

## Key Features

- **Prototype Optimization**: Strategically designed, optimized, and tested 7 robotic system prototypes, reducing design-to-prototype turnaround time by 15% and enhancing competition readiness.
- **Precise Motion Algorithms**: Developed precise motion algorithms on an STM32 F446RE platform, incorporating PID control for wheel speed regulation and orientation correction, achieving minimal deviations of ±1mm.
- **Dynamic Navigation Control**: Utilized Python and ROS to control 2 collaborative robots for complex navigation and object manipulation in dynamic environments, reducing mission time by 21%.
- **Enhanced Acceleration Control**: Refined control algorithms for faster acceleration and deceleration, resulting in a 19% reduction in travel time and improved adaptability in diverse navigation scenarios.
- **Innovative Trajectory Planning**: Implemented a novel trajectory planning algorithm incorporating constrained Delaunay triangulation for obstacle avoidance and optimal velocity profiling, boosting movement efficiency by 32%.
- **Robust Coordinate Transformation**: Developed a robust coordinate transformation algorithm using OpenCV solvePnP for accurate object detection and visual servoing across different frames.
- **Code Structure Optimization**: Improved STM32 and Raspberry Pi source code structure and clarity, reducing debugging time by 20% and enhancing team productivity for seamless deployment and integration.
- **Strategic Execution**: Executed a meticulous plan on D-Day, fostering team motivation and securing 1st place in the 2023 Eurobot Nationals.
